In this project, I built a movie recommender system that takes in user input and comes up with movie suggestions for you to watch. I also created a movie dashboard using data from multiple sources. Finally, I created a web-page with the project description, dashboard, and recommender system. The Content Based Recommender System recommends movies similar to the movie user likes and analyses the sentiments on the reviews given by the user for that movie.

Similarity Score :

It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

* **Skills demonstrated:** Pandas, Numpy, Natural Language Processing, Flask
* **Input:** The kaggle dataset: movie_metadata.csv
* **Output:** Get recommended movies based on user data 

# [Project 2: Face-Recognition-Attendance-Projects](https://github.com/Srujanpolepally7/Face-Recognition-Attendance-Projects)

In this project, The system was created to provide a simple and secure method of recording attendance. The software initially takes a picture of all of the authorized people and stores it in a database. The image is then stored by mapping it into a face coordinate structure by the system.

* **Skills demonstrated:** Pandas, Numpy, cv2, openCV, face_reognition

# [Project 3: Extract-Text-Summerization](https://github.com/Srujanpolepally7/Extract-Text-Summerization)

In this project I created a web application for text summerization. The method of constructing a condensed version of the original text while maintaining crucial information is known as text summarizing. Humans are natural summarizers since we can comprehend the overall meaning of a document simply by reading it.

There are two methods of text summarization:
Extractive Summary : This method summarizes the text by selecting the most important subset of sentences from the original text. As the name suggests, it extracts the most important information from the text. This method does not have the capability of text generation by itself and hence the output will always have some part of the original text.
Abstractive Summary : The idea behind this method is to understand the core context of the original text and produce new text based on this understanding. It can be compared to the way humans read and summarize text in their own way. The output of abstractive summary can have elements not present in the original text.

 **Skills demonstrated:**  Flask, NLTK, Networkx.

# [Project 4: Spam-SMS-Classifier-App](https://github.com/Srujanpolepally7/Spam-SMS-Classifier-App)

In this project I will explain you how to Build a SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning in Python

We will use algorithms such as :-
Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
Support Vector Machine

 **Skills demonstrated:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Scikit-Learn, Pandas


# [Project 5: Telco-Churn-Prediction-App](https://github.com/Srujanpolepally7/Telco-Churn-Prediction)
![churn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77172036/123608334-f363c880-d7fe-11eb-8bd8-fd11cdc7481f.jpg)

In this project I created web application for churn prediction. The analyses of the data
Nowadays it is necessary for Telco firms to acquire new customers while preventing termination of contracts.

Looking at churn, multiple factors lead consumers to cancel their contracts, such as better pricing deals, more interesting packages, poor service experiences or changing personal conditions for customers.

The main challenge is to determine whether or not an individual customer is going to churn.
* **Skills demonstrated:** Pandas, Matplotllib, Machine Learning Models
* **Input:** The Telco Churn dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
* **Output:**  Whether or not an individual customer is going to churn.
